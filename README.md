## OpenListings Coding Challenge

1. To review question 1 navigate to /01/
   * bundle install
   * run `bundle exec rspec --color -f d`
   * code lives in 01/lib/arr_dimension.rb
   * RSPEC tests live in 01/spec/arr_dimension_spec.rb
2. To review question 2 navigate to /02/
   * bundle install
   * run `bundle exec rspec --color -f d`
   * code lives in 02/lib/file_paths.rb
   * RSPEC tests live in 02/spec/file_finder_spec.rb
3. To review question 3 navigate to /03/matrix_api_wrapper
   * run npm install
   * run npm start
   * App will be running on localhost:3000  
      * If I was going to continue implementing a more feature rich verion of this API wrapper, I'd allow users to select mode of transportation (Walking, Driving, Biking).
      * I would also add in a google map component with pins of the start and end destination in order to visualize the commute.
      * I would finally, implement a feature that allowed users to swap the origin and destination, to plan for round trips.
